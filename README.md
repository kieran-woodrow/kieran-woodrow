- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kieran-woodrow

- ðŸ‘€ I love what i do. I'm a native iOS developer. I'm looking for a company who is not afraid to use the latest and greatest technology that Apple is pushing innovation such as SwiftUI, VisionPro etc. A company who has a massive legacy codebase and no one actually knows how it works is not an environment I want to work in again.
I'm looking for a company who values modern ways of working and promotes the idea that your life doesn't have to be your job, but rather embraces your life and job can both be done at the same time in a remote environment.
Outside of work, i enjoy being outdoors, playing a variety of sports and spending good time with mates.

- ðŸŒ± I started my tech journey in university when i chose to study computer science and applied maths. It opened my eyes and i got to explore a glimpse of all the tech world has to offer. Throughout my studies, we delved into cyber security, AI/ML, backend systems, frontend systems, database engineering, optimisation with algorithms, the world of networking, game development and computer graphics, a lot of math models and applications of maths. I took a deep interest in the AI/ML world. It is a passion I still pursue today. However, I never really explored mobile development. More specifically, the Apple environment such as iOS, iPadOS etc.
I have always admired apple and their push for innovation, so I decided to delve into it. I fully enjoyed it and decided started my professional career as an iOS developer. I am now an intermediate iOS mobile engineer. I have been at a company who is on the cutting edge with using SwiftUI. But i am hungry for more. I am not limiting myself specifically to iOS. I consider myself as a software engineer, so to me, I strive to not be technology specific driven, but solution driven to a presented problem. One of the first apps I build with a team of 5 was an educational app and website that aimed to enhance the learning process. The app was built around the idea of using AR/VR technology with 3D models that users could see on the screen of their device. Flutter was the tech used as the solution for this multi-platform problem.

-I've worked in agile environments following scrum principles.
-Implemented new core features into the app.
-Involved in architecture solutions for iOS to iPadOS.
-Research and analysi
