- 👋 Hi, I’m @kieran-woodrow. I'm from South Africa and I'm 26.

- 🚀 Over the years, i've dabbled in a lot. From writing assembly code for mathamatical calculations, to using python and Jupyter notebook for AI for facial recognition, to building data structures like BPlus trees from scratch in Java, to 3D graphics in Javascript and HTML to visully see the changes, to implementing design patterns in C++, to having complex sql quereies and database dumps, to having a Hero App in iOS and Swift. My profile has all the source code to the stuff i've played around with.

- 👀 Currently where I'm at in my career is i'm a native iOS developer. I love what I do. I enjoy using the latest and greatest technology that Apple is pushing such as SwiftUI and VisionPro to create apps that bring user experiences to life.

- 🌱 I started my tech journey in university when I chose to study computer science and applied maths. It opened my eyes and I got to explore a glimpse of all the tech world has to offer. Throughout my studies, I delved into cyber security, AI/ML, backend systems, frontend systems, database engineering, optimisation with algorithms, the world of networking, game development and computer graphics, a lot of math models and applications of maths. I took a deep interest in the AI/ML world as well as the mobile development space.

- 📍 I have always admired Apple and their push for innovation, so I decided to delve into it and become an iOS fanboy. I fully enjoyed it and decided started my professional career as an iOS developer. I am now an intermediate iOS mobile engineer. I have been at a company who is on the cutting edge with using SwiftUI. But i am hungry for more.  However, I am not limiting myself specifically to iOS. I consider myself as a software engineer, so to me, I strive to not be technology specific driven, but solution driven to a presented problem.
